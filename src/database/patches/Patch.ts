/**
* Patches are small scripts that bring the database or filesystem up to date.

* Patches are expected to go in a linear fashion. I.e., while patches have preconditions
* to make sure they can actually be executed (think: Patch B adds a column to a database table,
* but Patch A must have created that table first). This mechanism serves more as a sanity check,
* and is only a very weak safety not -- circular dependencies and other fancy stuff is not
